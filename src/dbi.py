"""The Daviesâ€“Bouldin index (DBI) (introduced by David L. Davies and 
Donald W. Bouldin in 1979) is a metric for evaluating clustering algorithms. 
This is an internal evaluation scheme, where the validation of how well the 
clustering has been done is made using quantities and features inherent to the 
dataset.

This implementation just computes DBI of two clusters.
